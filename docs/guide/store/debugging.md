# Debugging

Because this module integrates with Vuex for storing data, it also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.

It is highly recommended that developers make use of the extension for debugging data reflected into the store by this library. Being able to see the data in the frontend store when working with this module has a similar value to being able to see data in a relational database when building an application schema.

You can install the Vue devtools extension for Google Chrome [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en).
